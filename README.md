# GuessWord
A 'Hangman' like game; where the user is instructed to guess a random word by entering a series of letters. The word is chosen from a words.txt file in the program directory.

Inspiration and guidance for this project came from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aAkDVXxNhk&index=5&list=PLhP5GzqIk6qsYjU_3tod0nqoWGXlq9RvF and https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2014/06/05/five-mini-programming-projects-for-the-python-beginner
